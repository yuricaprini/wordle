WELCOME = Welcome to Wordle!\n\
          In this addicting word-guessing game, you'll be tasked\n\
          with uncovering a secret word consisting of 10 letters.\n\
          You have a maximum of 12 attempts to guess the secret word.\n\
          After each guess, the clues will guide you. \n\
          Here's the breakdown: \n\
          - A red letter is not present in the secret word.\n\
          - A yellow letter is present, but in wrong position.\n\
          - A green letter is present, and in correct position.\n\
          Use this feedback wisely to refine your guesses and solve\n\
          the puzzle within the given attempts. Good luck!
